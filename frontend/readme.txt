README: Getting started with your Mobirise AI website

This README will guide you through the simple steps to open your AI-generated project file in the Mobirise app.

Step 1: Extract your website files
You need to unzip the whole folder with downloaded files to access site files and your project file properly.

Step 2: Open the Mobirise app
It's required to have version 5.9.0 or a more recent version installed.
If you havenâ€™t already installed the Mobirise app, visit https://mobirise.com/history.html to download and install it.
Once installed, open the Mobirise app on your device.

Step 3: Import your project file
In the Mobirise app, navigate to the 'Sites' list. Click on the 'Import Mobirise Site' button to import your project
file. Select the project.mobirise file you extracted from the zipped folder.

Step 4: Start editing
Now that your project is imported, you can edit and customize the generated site to make it uniquely yours. Feel free to
experiment with different styles, layouts, and content. You can also add other available blocks.
